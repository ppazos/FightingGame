2D Game in C++


This game was created almost 10 years ago, when I was studying 2D and 3D collision detection. It also has gravity when you jump.
The game includes smoe pictures of my best friend and some stolen from other games like Marvel vs. Street Fighter.
It is a simple game, it uses SDL for input control and image rendering.
